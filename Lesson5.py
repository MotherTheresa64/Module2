# ====================
# Lesson 5: File Handling
# ====================

# ðŸ“Œ Brief Overview:
# In this lesson, you'll learn the fundamentals of Python file handlingâ€”how to open, read, write, and append to files.
# You will also explore how to manage structured data, such as lists, dictionaries, and custom data formats, using files.
# By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to build a simple program that interacts with files to store and retrieve data interactively.

# ====================
# Engage & Apply: Mid-Lesson Exercise
# ====================

# Task: Create a simple Python program that:
# - Allows the user to add favorite foods to a list.
# - Stores the data in a file.
# - Lets the user view or remove items from the list.

# Example solution for managing a list of favorite foods
